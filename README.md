Goal:

To fetch tweets from twitter, using Twitter API. Store them in MongoDB. Get familiar with StreamListener calls and NoSQL database operations. Use these tweets for sentiment analysis or try building an application.

Roadmap:

Implemented the python script to fetch the tweets. Still working on optimizing the code.
Uploaded the sample json file with tweets using the keyword. ['emoji']
Looking forward to start with the back-end part soon.
